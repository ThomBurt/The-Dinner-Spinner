# The_Dinner_Spinner

//**USER STORY**//
As a user I want to see a list of restaurants in a destination of my choosing so I can easily find a place to eat.
I want to view restaurants within a city of my choosing and select a cuisine of my choice, or a random cuisine.
When I click the search button I am presented with a list of 10 restaurants in both a list and a random spinner wheel.
When I click Spin, it will pick a restaurant and random and save it to my dinner history.
When I click on a restaurant from the presented list, it will save to my dinner history.
You can choose to both pick a random restaurant using the spinner, or choosing from the list.
